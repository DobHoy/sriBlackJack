services I need 

game service 
dealer service 
card service 



Steps:

  Overhead
  0)Create game => game service
    Create deck => deck service/game service 


  1) how many players? Plyerservice => create x players
  2) create a dealer => gamer service/dealer 

  game 
  1) deal each player 2 cards 
  2) start game 
    player 1 first turn -> stay? or deal(dealer calls card service)
    player 2 first turn -> stay? or deal
    anytime? dealer can delcare lose/win/draw (dealer service)


dealer service 
-> check game win state 
-> deal card/s 


game service 
  -> add players 
  -> create dealer
  -> create a new game

  Create a game 
    -game state -> gameOver
    -init game stuff

card service 
  -> deal 1 card
  -> deal 2 cards 
  -> shuffle 





STEPS
dealer shuffles deck
dealer deals 2 cards per player
dealer declares win/loss/players out of game
One at a time, players in the game can either (repeatable)
 - keep the cards they have or 
 - get dealt another card
 - dealer declares win/loss/players out of game
